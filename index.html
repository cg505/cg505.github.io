		about me
	</h3>

	<p>
		I'm a junior at UC Berkeley. I love to <a href="#code" class="int-link">code</a> and make <a href="#music" class="int-link">music</a>. I <a href="#capitalism" class="int-link">work</a> as a software engineer. Want to <a href="#contact" class="int-link">get in touch</a>?

		code
	</h3>

	<p>
		My longest-running active project is <a href="https://github.com/kotct/dot">kotct/dot</a>. dot is a tool for creating universally-available personal configurations, supporting GNU Emacs. Any dot user can seamlessly fetch and enable any other user's configuration, with just a few keystrokes. You can find my own dot-compatible emacs config at <a href="https://github.com/cg505/.emacs">cg505/.emacs</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I waste massive amounts of my life at the Berkeley <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/">Open Computing Facility</a>. As a ~~Technical Manager~~ (aka I have root access), I share responsibility for the computer lab of 29 computers and the array of servers which provide webhosting, high performance computing, and general server access to the Berkeley campus. Check out some of the <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/">services</a> that the OCF provides.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also am a member of <a href="https://pcsberkeley.wixsite.com/pcsberkeley">Political Computer Science @ Berkeley</a>. I'm working on a project that aims to provide organizers and activists with recommendations for bills they might care about. This Machine Learning (ooOOooO) project is in conjunction with <a href="https://www.gatheractivism.com/">Gather Activism</a>, a small Chicago-based startup.
	</p>

	<p>
		I've also worked at a smattering of jobs, as a software engineer and otherwise.
	</p>

	<p>
		At <a href="https://www.angieslist.com">Angie's List</a>, I converted a price comparison tool from an outdated web stack to use Angie's List's new <a href="http://thunderball.io/">Thunderball</a> stack (and along the way made some contributions to Thunderball itself). I also reworked some shared microservice Scala libraries for request processing.
	</p>

	<p>
		I worked for two summers at <a href="https://purduestudio.org/">Studio by Purdue</a>. During Summer 2016, I brought <a href="https://www.academicforecast.org/">Forecast</a> to life, contributing code from top (React/Redux) to bottom (ASP.NET). As the fall semester began, we deployed this app in time for my freshman class to use it during orientation. For Summer 2018, I focused on <a href="https://openpassport.org">Passport</a>, which is used widely at Purdue, as well as at some other institutions like University of Arizona. The focus of Passport is in awarding badges to learners, and our task was to add the ability to expire or revoke badges. This was a great exercise in making some pretty fundamental design changes to a (relatively) legacy application.

	<h3>
		music
	</h3>
	<p>
		I like jazz. I play alto saxophone in a combo at <a href="https://ucjazz.berkeley.edu/">UC Jazz</a> with fellow Cal students.
	</p>

	<p>
		At Purdue I played alto sax in the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/bands/ensembles/jazz/">Purdue Jazz Band</a>. Check out our rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ6eGiIaIgM">"Angel Eyes"</a> featuring yours truly.
	</p>

	<p>
		In high school I played tenor saxophone in a jazz combo called <a href="https://facebook.com/rednotejazz">Red Note</a>. Here's some videos of me playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUGaeLRQANM">"The Christmas Song"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcqE-VlbuTc">"Hotline Bling"</a> with them.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also sometimes find time for amateur composition and production. You can find some tunez on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cg505">soundcloud</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I listen to a lot of music, not just jazz. From Mitski to Tennyson to Injury Reserve, I love to talk to other people who are always trying to discover that next album that they love. See my listening history on <a href="https://last.fm/user/cg505">last.fm</a>, or try one of my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/cg505">spotify playlists</a>.
