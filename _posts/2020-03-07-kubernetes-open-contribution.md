title: 'Kubernetes and open contribution at OCF'
summary: |
  Talk: How we use Kubernetes at OCF to encourage contribution,
  presented at the UC Berkeley Cloud Meetup.
---
This January, my fellow OCF officers Patricia Janus and Ja Wattanawong gave a talk at the [UC Berkeley Cloud Computing Meetup](https://cto.berkeley.edu/cloud/community/meetup).

The [OCF](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/) is a student-run, volunteer organization, and we run a lot of stuff.
Everything we do is oriented around making sure it is easy for volunteers to jump in and start contributing.
If you've worked with Kubernetes before, you'd be reasonable to question how it can help us achieve that goal.
Well, we decided to explain how and why we use Kubernetes, and show you a few tricks we learned along the way.
